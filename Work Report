26.8
    13:00 - 15:00, Finding the right API
        1. Experimented with OpenAI's API:
            - Had to find a different solution since its no loger free

        2. Experimented with SentenceTransformers:
            - Had trouble installing Torch
            - After managing to use the api I found its not so user friendly

        3. Experimented with Groq:
            - Had trouble setting the API Key as an environment variable, decided in
            the meantime to read it from a text file (api key.txt)
            - Easy to use, and provides an in-depth sentiment analysis of text using
            a relatively simple prompt ("Analyze the sentiment of the following sentence:")

        NEXT STEP: Create an interface for easy usage (for users) and testing (for myself)
